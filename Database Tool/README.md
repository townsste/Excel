This is a Time Tracking Excel workbook that I made to track an employees hours for specified work orders.

Please see the pdf and images for a look into the excel file.  

I have also attached a working example of the excel file.

I used VBA to code the workbook.  There is a GUI where you can input your information.  

The GUI will search for an emeployee based on the information in the database list.

On the summary sheet there is a section where I inputted all the employees in the format of (FistName LastName)
